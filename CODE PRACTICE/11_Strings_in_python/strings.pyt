# Strings in python programming language.
# Strings are used in python programming language to record text information, such as name. Strings in python are actually a sequence, which basically means python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence. For example, python understands the string "hello" to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter).

# This idea of a sequence is an important one in python and we will touch upon it later on in the future.
